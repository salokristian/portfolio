# A solar system simulator project 
### Basic course in programming with Python, Aalto-university

#### Functionality

The program runs a simulation about the solar system. The SolarSystem.txt file includes initialization data for planets in the solar system. The user can add objects as desired and then run the simulation. Saving the completed simulation is also possible. The game uses a Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm for the physics.

#### Requirements

The program uses Pygame version 1.9.2 and PyQT version 4. Other versions of Pygame should work, but PyQT 4 is required in any case. The program is execution is started by running main.py.
